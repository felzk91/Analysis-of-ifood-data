In this project, I will conduct data mining on a grocery firm's marketing data to uncover insights and provide marketing recommendations. The project is divided into three main parts:

Part 1: Customer Segmentation

I will segment the customers into three clusters using hierarchical clustering. This segmentation will be based on:

-Demographic information -Purchasing behaviors -Amount spent in each product category

Part 2: Regression Analysis

To understand the relationship between the total amount spent by each customer and other variables, I will perform a regression analysis. The regression model will predict how much a customer will spend, adhering to the principles of parsimony by selecting as few variables as possible that still explain the majority of the variance.

Part 3: Analysis of Spending Differences

I will examine whether the amount spent differs across different marital statuses and education levels. Additionally, I will investigate if there is any interaction between customers' response to the latest marketing campaign and their education level on the amount they spend.

By completing these analyses, we will gain valuable insights into customer behavior, which will inform targeted marketing strategies.
